<p><strong>Mechanical Tsar</strong> is an engine for mechanized labor workflows.</p>

<p>Crowdsourcing is an established approach for producing and analyzing data that can be represented as a human-assisted
    computation system. Mechanical Tsar is a crowdsourcing engine that makes it possible to run a highly customizable
    hosted crowdsourcing platform controlling the entire annotation process including such elements as task allocation,
    worker ranking and result aggregation.</p>
